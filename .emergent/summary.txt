The AI engineer successfully developed the Hackov8 hackathon platform, progressing from initial setup to a feature-rich application. The journey involved implementing core functionalities like public website display, comprehensive authentication (Google OAuth, email/password), and distinct user roles (Admin, Organizer, Judge, Participant). Key focus areas included creating various dashboards, managing hackathons, registrations, and submissions, all while maintaining a consistent purple & black theme and utilizing Shadcn UI components for a modern look. The engineer meticulously incorporated UI/UX enhancements, adding animations, gradient effects, and improving visual appeal. Debugging efforts concentrated on resolving frontend interaction issues, such as button clickability and modal overlays. The work is currently focused on refining UI/UX and addressing remaining interactive bugs before a full production deployment.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build Hackov8, a platform to streamline hackathon hosting, management, and judging.

**Core Features Implemented/Requested:**
*   **Public Website:** Homepage with featured hackathons, detailed hackathon pages (timeline, prizes, mentors, FAQs), registration links, search/filter, and static pages (About, FAQ, Contact, Terms).
*   **Authentication:** Email/password login/signup, Google OAuth (initially only Google, later expanded), password reset, and email verification. Session management uses local storage.
*   **User Roles:** Admin (full control, global stats, analytics), Organizer (create/manage hackathons, event stats, participants, submissions), Judge (score assigned submissions), Participant (register, form teams, submit projects).
*   **Registration & Teams:** Solo/team registration, team creation/invite links, team size limits.
*   **Organizer Dashboard:** Create/edit hackathons (title, cover image/banner, prizes, rules, judging rubrics, timelines), manage participants, view registrations, and download data (CSV export).
*   **Submissions & Judging:** Teams submit projects (GitHub, video, files), judges score based on rubrics, and admins publish winners.
*   **Admin Panel:** View total users, hackathons, registrations, submissions, teams, manage user roles/permissions, moderate content, view analytics, and CSV data export.
*   **Notifications:** Email notifications for key actions (registration, submission, results), in-app notification system (though not explicitly detailed in implementation).
*   **UI/UX:** Secure, scalable, mobile-responsive UI with a consistent purple & black brand theme. Emphasis on modern design, animations, increased spacing, subtle textures, custom cursors, and use of Shadcn UI components. Avoidance of generic layouts and prohibited color/gradient combinations.

**Tech Stack:** Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS; Backend: FastAPI with MongoDB.
**MVP Goals:** Users can register/login, Admin creates/manages hackathons, Participants register/team/submit, Judges score, Admin dashboard with stats, Email notifications.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix Frontend Button/Modal Interaction:** Resolve issues where Get Started, Start Your Journey, and Explore Hackathons buttons on the landing page are not fully clickable or are being blocked by overlays/modals after initial interaction.
-   **Enhance UI/UX of User Dashboard:** Further improve the visual design and user experience of the  page for participants.
-   **Complete UI/UX of Hackathon Published Page:** Ensure the  page is fully polished and visually appealing.
-   **Deployment:** Ensure the platform is fully production-ready and deployed without issues.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on two main fronts:
1.  **Fixing Frontend UI Interaction Issues:** The most immediate task is to diagnose and resolve persistent problems with button clickability on the  page. Specifically, Get Started, Start Your Journey, and Explore Hackathons buttons are reported as not working consistently. Previous attempts involved adjusting  in  for background elements (, ) to prevent them from blocking clicks. A recent test showed the Get Started button *did* open the , but the user implied other buttons were still problematic or the modal itself caused issues with subsequent interactions, indicating the fix isn't complete.

2.  **Enhancing UI/UX for Key Dashboards/Pages:** Following user feedback to update the ui ux of user dashboard, hackathon published ui ux and organizer dashboard, the AI has started implementing these visual improvements:
    *   **User Dashboard:**  was modified for enhanced UI/UX.
    *   **Hackathon Detail Page:** A new  was created, and  was updated to use this enhanced version.
    *   **Organizer Dashboard:** While not explicitly modified in the *last* few steps for general UI/UX, previous steps already integrated functionalities like banner image uploads and registration viewing into .

The current state is that the core features are largely implemented, but the platform is not yet production-ready due to these ongoing UI interaction bugs and remaining UI/UX polishing tasks across key user-facing pages.
