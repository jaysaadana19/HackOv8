The AI engineer successfully transformed Hackov8 from an MVP into a feature-rich application, addressing a wide range of user requests. The work began by fixing critical frontend button interaction issues on the landing page, then moved into significant UI/UX enhancements across key dashboards and the implementation of a comprehensive admin panel. Subsequent efforts focused on adding core functionalities like organizer notifications, banner image uploads, and a light/dark mode theme toggle. A major part of the trajectory involved iterative theme redesigns, transitioning from purple/black to Teal/Navy, then white/black, and finally a specific White + Teal + Navy palette, with careful attention to text visibility. Google OAuth was re-integrated and later removed, followed by a custom AuthModal redesign. The engineer also debugged image display issues, improved event timelines, and added social profile options for hackathons. The current work involves enabling organizers to edit live hackathons and implementing team invite codes with size validation.

The Hackov8 platform aims to streamline hackathon hosting, management, and judging. Initially, core features included a public website, comprehensive authentication (email/password, Google OAuth), distinct user roles (Admin, Organizer, Judge, Participant), registration/team functionalities, organizer dashboard with hackathon CRUD and participant management (including CSV export), submissions/judging, and an admin panel for global oversight. UI/UX emphasized a consistent purple & black theme, modern design, animations, and Shadcn UI components.

Throughout the development, the user explicitly requested:
1.  Fixing button clickability on the landing page (Get Started, Start Your Journey, Explore Hackathons).
2.  Enhancing the UI/UX of the user dashboard, hackathon published UI/UX, and organizer dashboard.
3.  A comprehensive admin panel for approving/deleting hackathons, viewing user onboarding/retention stats, and product growth analytics (7/30/90 days, all time). This included email notifications for new hackathon submissions.
4.  A notification service for organizers to send updates to participants.
5.  An option for banner image upload (in addition to URL link) for hackathons.
6.  Light mode and dark mode options for user, organizer, and main dashboards.
7.  Changing the platform's color theme: first to Arctic White + Teal Mint + Navy Blue, then to a modern white and black (Devfolio-like), and finally to a specific White + Teal + Navy palette with given hex codes.
8.  Fixing white text visibility issues and ensuring light mode on the main landing page.
9.  Fixing Google sign-in/sign-up and integrating a specific Google Client ID. This was later followed by a request to remove the Google sign-in option and redesign the sign-in/sign-up box UI/UX.
10. Fixing the sign-up box size to be accurate.
11. Fixing an issue where uploaded banner images were not showing on hackathon and main pages.
12. Fixing the hackathon preview page event timeline (removing black boxes).
13. Adding options for organizers to include social profiles (visible on the event page) and a community URL (Slack/Discord).
14. Allowing organizers to edit any live hackathon details (including new fields).
15. Implementing team invite codes for participants to join teams, with validation based on criteria set by organizers.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently working on two related features:
1.  **Allowing Organizers to Edit Live Hackathons:** The  component was found to be basic. It has now been comprehensively rewritten to include all the new fields that are present in the , such as banner image upload, social profiles, and community URLs, ensuring organizers can modify all aspects of a hackathon, even if it's live. This part is largely implemented on the frontend.
2.  **Team Invite Codes with Validation:** The backend  model already contains an  field. The current focus is on modifying the  and  endpoints in  to incorporate validation logic based on criteria set by organizers (e.g., team size limits) and to properly handle the generation and usage of these invite codes for joining teams. The last action was to update the  and  endpoints to add validation for team size.
