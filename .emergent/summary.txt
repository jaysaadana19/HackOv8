The AI engineer significantly enhanced the Hackov8 platform, transforming it from an MVP into a feature-rich application. Initial work involved fixing frontend UI issues, particularly button clickability on the landing page, and addressing critical  incompleteness. Core features like team invite codes, image upload validation, and dynamic content rendering (random banners) were implemented. Major strides were made in improving user experience, including allowing guest viewing of hackathon details and integrating a functional AuthModal. Subsequent efforts focused on complex backend and frontend additions, such as multi-organizer support, email verification, a dedicated Settings page, and robust admin functionalities like user role management, analytics visualization using Recharts, and featured hackathon controls. SEO-friendly slugs were integrated, and crucial fixes like missing social profile fields in backend models and toast notification visibility were resolved. The trajectory demonstrates an iterative, user-driven development process with frequent checks and confirmations.

The Hackov8 platform aims to be a comprehensive solution for hackathon hosting, management, and participation. Starting from an MVP with authentication, user roles, hackathon CRUD, and judging, development has expanded significantly. Explicit user requests covered: fixing landing page button interactions; enhancing UI/UX for dashboards; building a robust admin panel for hackathon approval, analytics, and data export with email notifications; adding an organizer notification service; enabling banner image uploads with specific size/dimension validation; implementing light/dark mode; iterating through multiple theme changes (purple/black to Teal/Navy, then white/black, finally White+Teal+Navy); fixing text visibility; integrating/removing Google OAuth; redesigning AuthModal; fixing image display; improving event timelines; adding social profiles/community links for organizers; allowing organizers to edit live hackathons; and implementing team invite codes with size validation. Recent additions include password reset functionality, email verification for new users, footer content updates, and featured hackathons display.
