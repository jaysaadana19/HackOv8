The AI engineer continued developing the Hackov8 platform, addressing a diverse range of user requests. Initial work focused on critical deployment issues, guiding the user on custom domain setup and diagnosing a  misconfiguration in production. The application was successfully renamed from team-hackathon to hackov8 across frontend, backend, and documentation. A major effort was dedicated to fixing a registration bug for new and existing users, stemming from a missing  field in the  model and stale frontend user data. The platform's UI/UX received significant attention, including making all core pages mobile-responsive and a complete redesign of the Hackathon Detail page to align with a White + Teal + Navy theme, fixing numerous styling and layout issues. Feature additions included displaying hackathon registration counts, implementing solo participation logic, enabling organizer view for co-organized hackathons, adding a mark all notifications as read feature, and introducing dedicated sections and management UI for sponsors and judges. The trajectory concludes with the implementation of a judge assignment system, updating backend models and creating frontend UI, with the Judge Dashboard update as the immediate next step.

<product_requirements>
The Hackov8 platform is a comprehensive solution for hackathon management. The user's explicit requests and the problem statement indicate a continuous evolution from an MVP to a feature-rich application.
**Core Problems Addressed:**
1.  **Deployment Issues:** Users faced challenges deploying custom domains and connecting to a production database.
2.  **Branding:** Renaming the platform from team-hackathon to hackov8 for consistent branding.
3.  **Registration Flow:** A critical bug where users (newly signed up or existing) were unable to register for hackathons from the event detail page due to authentication and role validation issues.
4.  **UI/UX & Responsiveness:** Enhancing the entire platform's mobile and tablet responsiveness, and redesigning the hackathon detail page for better aesthetics (originally fixing dark theme issues, then reverting to a White+Teal+Navy theme).
5.  **Organizer Tools:** Improving event visibility for co-organizers, enabling the addition of co-organizers, and allowing organizers to manage sponsors and judges.
6.  **Participant Experience:** Implementing solo participation logic for 1-1 team sizes, displaying registration counts instead of team counts, and adding a mark all notifications as read feature.
7.  **Judge Management:** Allowing organizers to assign judges by email to specific hackathons, and ensuring judges only see assigned events.

**Implementation Summary:**
The AI engineer has addressed branding, deployment configuration, a major registration bug, UI responsiveness and theming, and several key features for organizers and participants (co-organizers, sponsors, judges, solo participation).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing a **Judge Assignment System**.

**Work Done So Far:**
1.  **Backend ():**
    *   The  model was updated to include .
    *   New API endpoints were added for managing judge assignments:  (to add a judge by email) and  (to remove a judge).
    *   A new endpoint  was created to allow a logged-in judge to retrieve only the hackathons they have been assigned to.
    *   Several syntax and indentation errors encountered during the backend implementation were resolved, and the backend service successfully restarted.

2.  **Frontend ():**
    *   Corresponding API functions (, , ) were added to the  module (or relevant API module).

3.  **Frontend ():**
    *   A new React component  was created. This modal will provide the UI for organizers to input judge email IDs and manage assignments for a specific hackathon.

4.  **Frontend ():**
    *   State variables (, ) were added to control the visibility and context of the new .
    *   A Manage Judges button was added to the hackathon card actions (e.g., in a dropdown menu) to allow organizers to open the  for a specific hackathon.

The backend has been updated, the necessary API calls are defined on the frontend, and the UI for organizers to *manage* judges has been integrated into the . The next critical step is to update the  itself to filter hackathons based on these assignments.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update the  to fetch and display only the hackathons that the currently logged-in judge is assigned to, using the new backend endpoint.
