<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial problem was a server crash during certificate generation. This evolved into a series of feature requests and bug fixes, including multiple cycles of adding and removing Google authentication, implementing a mandatory email verification system, and creating a public-facing user profile to act as a CV. More recently, the user has been focused on fixing a frustrating and persistent issue where the application works in the preview environment but is broken on the live deployment URL (), specifically concerning the login and dashboard access flows. The latest feature request was to remove all certificate-related functionality and significantly enhance the user profile to function as a comprehensive, visually appealing CV, including fields for experience, education, skills, and social media links.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack hackathon management platform using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key features include user authentication (email/password and Google Sign-In), a mandatory email verification system, and a public profile page designed to function as a CV. The certificate generation features have been removed from the UI and backend routes. The backend  model has been expanded to support detailed CV data. The UI for the public profile page has just undergone a redesign, but the corresponding editing interface on the user's private profile page has not been built yet. The application is plagued by a critical deployment issue where the live URL does not reflect the current state of the backend.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Redesigning the public profile page () to have a more modern and visually appealing UI to attract users. The agent made a series of edits to the file to implement a new design.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent needs to navigate to a public profile URL, take a screenshot, and verify the new design renders correctly without layout issues.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Critical Deployment Misconfiguration (P0)**
- **Issue 2: Public Profile Page Inaccessible via External URL (P1)**

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1: Critical Deployment Misconfiguration**
    - **Description:** The live deployment at  is not in sync with the development environment. API calls made from the live frontend fail or return outdated data (e.g., login fails, user data is missing), while the same calls work perfectly within the preview environment. The user is extremely frustrated by this, as fixes appear to work for the agent but not for them on the public URL.
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent confirmed code correctness, checked CORS settings, and validated environment variables. The  was called and concluded this is a platform-level deployment, routing, or database connectivity issue, not an application code bug.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        - **Do not attempt to fix this with more code changes.**
        - Inform the user clearly that this is a **platform configuration issue** that is outside the agent's control and requires intervention from Emergent support to fix the domain routing and/or database connection.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the highest priority blocker. The entire application is unusable on its public domain until this is resolved.
    - **Status:** BLOCKED
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    - **Blocked on other issue:** Blocked on external platform support.

- **Issue 2: Public Profile Page Inaccessible via External URL**
    - **Description:** A specific symptom of the larger deployment issue. The dynamic API endpoint  returns a  error when accessed through the public domain, blocking the entire public CV feature.
    - **Attempted fixes:** This was identified in the previous fork. The  diagnosed it as a platform ingress issue.
    - **Next debug checklist:** This issue will be resolved when the main deployment misconfiguration (Issue 1) is fixed. No separate code debugging is needed.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** It will make the public CV feature functional.
    - **Status:** BLOCKED
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend
    - **Blocked on other issue:** Issue 1: Critical Deployment Misconfiguration

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Public Profile CV Feature (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The backend models (, ) and the public display page () are ready. The next critical step is to build the editing UI on the main  page. This involves adding forms for users to input their experience, education, projects, skills, achievements, certifications, and social media links.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the user-facing CV feature, allowing users to create and manage their professional profile.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on something:** The feature cannot be fully tested on the public URL until the deployment issue (Issue 1) is resolved.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **(P1) Build UI for Set Password**: The backend endpoint  has been created to allow users who signed up with Google to create a password for email-based login. A UI element (e.g., a Set Password button and form) needs to be added to the  page.
  - **(P2) Verify and Fix SEO Implementation**: The agent struggled to implement dynamic SEO. The  component was found to be non-functional. This task was abandoned but remains incomplete. The component should be investigated, fixed, or replaced with a working solution (e.g., a  hook in each page).
- **Future Tasks:**
  - None defined.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Login & Verification Flow Overhaul:** Fixed the entire user authentication and verification flow. The backend now correctly returns  status, and the frontend logic for redirects (to dashboard vs. verification page) has been made robust. This fixed the main source of the user's frustration regarding login loops.
- **Role-Based Navigation:** Simplified the login redirect logic. All users now land on the main , which contains buttons to navigate to role-specific dashboards (Admin, Judge, etc.).
- **Certificate Feature Removal:** Completely removed all UI elements, API calls, and routes related to certificate generation and viewing from the  page and .
- **Google Sign-In Management:** Removed and then re-added Google Sign-In with new user-provided credentials, fixing UI bugs where the button wasn't appearing.
- **Public Profile Foundation:**
    - Updated the backend  model to include comprehensive fields for a CV (experience, education, skills, etc.).
    - Created and implemented a redesigned, modern UI for the public profile display page ().
- **Deployment URL Update:** The  in the backend  file was updated to  for use in verification emails.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **SEO Component is Not Working:** An attempt to implement dynamic SEO using  failed, likely due to a React 19 incompatibility or build issue. The  component does not render or apply meta tags. It is still imported in several pages, representing dead code.
    - **Debug checklist:** Confirm the component is not rendering. If so, remove the component and its usages. Re-implement dynamic meta tags using a simple  hook directly inside the page components that need it (, , ).
    - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** To fulfill the user's original request for improved search engine visibility.
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend.
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Public Profile Ingress Issue:** The 404 error on the public profile API endpoint persists from the previous session and is now understood to be part of the larger deployment misconfiguration.
- **User Indecisiveness on Social Logins:** The user has repeatedly toggled Google Sign-In on and off. The next agent should be prepared for this requirement to change again.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Full-Stack:** React frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, MongoDB database.
- **Authentication:** JWT for sessions via cookies, email/password, and Google OAuth2.
- **Deployment Debugging:** Differentiating between application code errors and platform-level deployment/configuration issues is critical for this project.
- **UI/UX Redesign:** Visual and structural overhaul of React components to improve user experience.

**All files**
*Created:*
- : A new, professionally designed page to display a user's public CV.
- : This file was created, but its logic was immediately moved into . It is now redundant.
*Updated:*
- : Major updates. Added a  endpoint. Expanded  and  Pydantic models with CV fields. Modified , , and  endpoints to return  status and/or session tokens.
- : Heavily modified to remove all certificate-related functionality.

- : Was planned for a major update but has not been implemented yet.
- : Routes for certificates were removed, and the public profile route was updated to point to .
-  (backend & frontend): Updated with new Google OAuth credentials and the correct frontend URL for email links.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The file  is unused and should be deleted.
- The  component is non-functional and is imported across multiple pages. It should be removed, and its functionality should be re-implemented correctly or discarded.

**key api endpoints**
- : (New) Allows an authenticated user to set a password. For Google sign-up users.
- : (Updated) Accepts all new CV fields (experience, education, etc.) for profile updates.
- : (Updated) API response now correctly includes the  boolean.
- : (Updated) Now returns a session token upon successful verification to log the user in automatically.
- : (Updated) No longer requires authentication and accepts an email in the request body.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **DEPLOYMENT IS BROKEN:** This is the most critical piece of information. The live URL  is pointing to an old backend or database. **Do not waste credits trying to fix user-reported bugs on the live site with code changes.** The code is correct in the preview environment. You must inform the user that this is a platform issue requiring Emergent support.
- **USER FRUSTRATION:** The user is very frustrated with the deployment issue. Manage communications carefully, being empathetic but firm that the problem is outside your control.
- **CV FEATURE - EDITING PENDING:** The CV feature is a top priority. The display page is done, but the main task is to build the editing UI on the  page.
- **SEO IS UNFINISHED:** The dynamic SEO feature is broken. Be prepared to address this if the user brings it up again.
